Tackling architecture's relationship of light and function, this project aims to explore architecture's response to sunlight. In an approach that incorporates the contextualization of the site, we were inspired by the existing natural vegetation around CFA. 
By citing our project around a tree, we were able to explore the dualities of light and shadow. By developing an inside-outside connection that opens up around the central space, occupants are able to participate in a diverse variations of experiences. Utilizing a simple repeating pattern of curves, the project embraces a single surface that is placed against a gentle slope. In exploration, the project both hovers and touches the ground plane to provide both shelter and comfort. 

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104549030/165810523-21ec4bae-7a8a-4b79-869d-185b403435f9.jpg)
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
