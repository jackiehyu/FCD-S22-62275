Located on a gentle sloped site within Carnegie Mellon University, Happy Days is a structure that responds to the context, basing its performance off of a tree at its heart. By citing our project around a tree, the experiences within the structure explore the dualities of light and shadow. By developing an inside-outside connection that opens up around the central space, occupants are able to participate in a diverse variations of experiences. Utilizing a simple repeating pattern of curves, the project embraces a single surface that acts as an area of rest by providing both a cantilevered space and sitting areas. In exploration, the project both hovers and touches the ground plane to provide both shelter and comfort. 


**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino & to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.


**3D Assets & Organization**

Components such as wooden panels, glass panels, and the spaceframe were baked into Rhino space. Additional panels to complete orthogonal shape of the plan were created from the starting paneling function of the Grasshopper script. Materiality is heavily dependent on V-Ray and Grasshopper custom preview.
